Spider Inductions Task 1 by Abhishek Jha, Roll No- 110123005.

I have completed all the levels. And have tried to add some additional features such as App Icon, Splash Screen etc and tried to have a bug free and clean UI. 

NAVIGATION- 
The app has app.jsx as it's main navigation file. I have used two navigators stack and bottom drawer.

SCREENS-
The App consists of multiple screens. All of them are listed under Screens except for one which is main.jsx
There is also a Utils directory that contains data.js and all the recipe images. Basically holds all the raw data.

To run the application, head over to Demo directory and download the 'RecipesbyAbhishek.apk' and view it in your phone. Demo directory also contains images of all the pages and functionality.

It was a great learning experience, looking forward to the upcoming tasks.
